        <p><i>Subtracting from your list of priorities is as important as adding to it. But sometimes it is okay to
                simply do nothing. Put down the priorities on a to-do list, cancel your plans, and just sit there
                and relax.</i><br><br>
            For such situations, you'll need one to remind you of your priorities. So, with this to-do list you can
            jot down your priorities which would remind you about them.
